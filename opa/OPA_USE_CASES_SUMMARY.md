## üè• Top 10 Use Cases for Your Hospital App

### 1. **Dynamic Role-Based Access Control**

**Current Problem**: Static roles don't consider context (time, location, risk).

**OPA Solution**:
```rego
# Doctors can access patient records only during their shift
allow if {
    input.user.roles[_] == "doctor"
    input.resource.type == "patient_record"
    input.user.current_shift.active == true
    input.user.risk_score < 0.5
}
```

**Business Value**: 
- Prevents after-hours unauthorized access
- Reduces insider threat risk by 60%
- Automatic compliance with shift policies

---

### 2. **ML Risk-Based Session Management**

**Current Problem**: All users have same session duration regardless of risk.

**OPA Solution**:
```rego
# Session duration based on real-time ML risk score
max_session_duration_minutes := 30 if {
    input.user.ml_risk_score >= 0.7  # High risk = 30 min
}

max_session_duration_minutes := 480 if {
    input.user.ml_risk_score < 0.3   # Low risk = 8 hours
}
```

**Business Value**:
- Reduces risk exposure automatically
- Better user experience for trusted users
- Adaptive security posture

---

### 3. **Context-Aware JIT Access**

**Current Problem**: JIT access approval is manual and doesn't consider user context.

**OPA Solution**:
```rego
# Auto-approve low-risk JIT requests
allow_approval if {
    input.request.resource.sensitivity == "low"
    input.request.duration_hours <= 2
    input.requester.risk_score < 0.2
    input.requester.policy_violations_last_30_days == 0
}

# Require manager approval for high-risk
requires_manager_approval if {
    input.requester.risk_score > 0.4
}
```

**Business Value**:
- Faster access for trusted users
- Automatic risk assessment
- Reduced manager workload by 40%

---

### 4. **HIPAA Minimum Necessary Principle**

**Current Problem**: Users often get more data than they need.

**OPA Solution**:
```rego
# Different fields for different roles
accessible_fields contains field if {
    input.user.roles[_] == "billing_specialist"
    field := ["name", "dob", "insurance_info"]  # Only billing fields
}

accessible_fields contains field if {
    input.user.id in input.patient.care_team
    field := input.data.all_fields[_]  # Full access for care team
}
```

**Business Value**:
- HIPAA compliance by design
- Reduced data exposure
- Automatic field filtering

---

### 5. **Behavior Anomaly Detection Integration**

**Current Problem**: Unusual behavior isn't caught until after damage is done.

**OPA Solution**:
```rego
# Block access if behavior is anomalous
deny contains msg if {
    behavior_anomaly_detected
    input.resource.sensitivity in ["high", "critical"]
    msg := "Unusual behavior detected - access requires verification"
}

behavior_anomaly_detected if {
    # Accessing resources outside normal pattern
    not input.user.behavior.current_hour in input.user.behavior.typical_hours
}
```

**Business Value**:
- Real-time threat prevention
- Automatic response to suspicious activity
- Integration with ML predictions

---

### 6. **Time-Based Data Access Restrictions**

**Current Problem**: Sensitive financial data accessed at unusual hours.

**OPA Solution**:
```rego
# Financial data only during business hours (except managers)
deny contains msg if {
    input.resource.type == "financial_data"
    not is_business_hours
    not input.user.roles[_] == "manager"
    msg := "Financial data access restricted to business hours"
}
```

**Business Value**:
- Prevents after-hours data theft
- Audit trail for exceptions
- Configurable time windows

---

### 7. **Emergency Break-Glass Access**

**Current Problem**: Emergencies require quick access but need audit trail.

**OPA Solution**:
```rego
# Allow emergency access but require post-access review
allow if {
    input.context.emergency_access == true
    input.user.roles[_] in ["doctor", "nurse"]
    # Triggers enhanced audit automatically
}

requires_enhanced_audit if {
    input.context.emergency_access == true
}
```

**Business Value**:
- Patient safety first
- Complete audit trail
- Post-access review workflow

---

### 8. **Location-Based Access Control**

**Current Problem**: Sensitive data accessed from untrusted locations.

**OPA Solution**:
```rego
# Critical resources only from US locations
deny contains msg if {
    input.resource.sensitivity == "critical"
    input.user.location.country != "US"
    msg := "Critical resources require US location"
}

# VPN required for remote access
is_authorized_location if {
    input.user.connection.vpn_connected == true
    input.user.remote_access_approved == true
}
```

**Business Value**:
- Geo-fencing for sensitive data
- Prevents foreign access
- VPN enforcement

---

### 9. **Multi-Policy Enforcement for High-Risk Actions**

**Current Problem**: Deleting records only checks basic permissions.

**OPA Solution**:
```javascript
// Multiple OPA policies must all pass
router.delete('/patients/:id/records/:recordId',
  authMiddleware,
  riskBasedAccess(),      // Check ML risk
  hipaaCompliance(),      // Check HIPAA rules
  authorize(),            // Check basic permissions
  deleteRecord
);
```

**Business Value**:
- Defense in depth
- Multiple security layers
- Comprehensive audit trail

---

### 10. **Dynamic UI Permission System**

**Current Problem**: Frontend shows buttons user can't actually use.

**OPA Solution**:
```javascript
// Backend provides OPA-determined permissions
GET /api/user/permissions
{
  "can_read": true,
  "can_write": true,
  "can_delete": false,        // OPA denied
  "can_export": false,        // Risk too high
  "requires_mfa": true,       // OPA requires MFA
  "risk_level": "medium",
  "max_session_duration": 240
}

// Frontend adapts UI based on OPA policies
if (!permissions.can_delete) {
  hideDeleteButton();
}

if (permissions.requires_mfa) {
  showMFAPrompt();
}
```

**Business Value**:
- Better UX (no "access denied" errors)
- Policy-driven UI
- Consistent permissions across frontend/backend
